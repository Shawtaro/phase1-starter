USLOSS Phase 1

Note that phase1[x].c may have some errors in implementation. For phase1[x+1].c rely on phase1[x] library:

e.g. to test phase1b.c, use libphase1a-1.0.a 
e.g. to test phase1c.c, use libphase1a-1.0.a and libphase1a-1.0.b

make sure the resulting file is named libphase1a-1.0.[x].
Create the directory ~/cs452/lib and put the library into it. 
Typing "make" in phase1[x+1] should link against this library.
